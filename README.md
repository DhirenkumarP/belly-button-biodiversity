# Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Description

The objective of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Diversity dataset which catalogs the microbes colonizing human navels.

### The dashboard includes:

- dropdown to examine data from each individual

- bar chart featuring the top ten microbial species (OTUs or operational taxonomic units)

- bubble chart featuring all microbial species

- gauge of the frequency of belly button washes weekly for each individual
